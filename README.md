# HEIGVD-RES-2016-Labo-SMTP

A simple SMTP client created in the RES course at HEIG-VD in order to become familiar with the protocol.

The idea of this project is to send a forged e-mail to a group of victims. The content of the mail is selected among a set of pre-defined messages and the various groups of victims are formed from a list of e-mails.
